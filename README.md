# Fraud Detection with Ensemble Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to detect fraudulent financial transactions. It includes **EDA**, **feature engineering**, and an **ensemble model** combining Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to improve precision and recall on highly imbalanced data.


## Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Provided CSV (`Fraud.csv`)
- **Rows**: 1,000,000+
- **Target**: `isFraud` (0 = not fraud, 1 = fraud)
- **Class imbalance**: ~0.05% frauds

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights:

- Only `TRANSFER` and `CASH_OUT` transactions involve fraud
- Fraud patterns:
  - Draining origin account (`newbalanceOrig = 0`)
  - Destination account starts empty and receives large amounts
- Merchants (`nameDest` starts with "M") never receive fraud

---

## Feature Engineering

We created custom features to capture fraud behavior:

- `balanceDiffOrig` = `oldbalanceOrg - newbalanceOrig`
- `balanceDiffDest` = `newbalanceDest - oldbalanceDest`
- `zeroBalanceAfter` = 1 if origin balance becomes 0
- `emptyDestBefore` = 1 if destination was empty
- `isMerchant` = 1 if destination is a merchant

## Model Strategy

### Base Models:
- `RandomForestClassifier`
- `GradientBoostingClassifier`

### Final Model:
- `VotingClassifier` (Soft Voting)
- Combines RF and GB to balance **precision** and **recall**

## Results

| Model              | Precision | Recall | AUC   |
|--------------------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Random Forest      | 0.75      | 0.41   | 0.961 |
| Gradient Boosting  | 0.71      | 0.41   | 0.977 |
| **Ensemble (Voting)** | **0.80**  | **0.60** | **0.958** |

Ensemble caught **more frauds** and made **fewer mistakes** than individual models.
